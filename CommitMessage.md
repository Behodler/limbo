# CliffFace gas consumption
It looks like a swap on Behodler through CliffFace proxy costs about as much as Uniswap. These figures will only become clear on a public testnet. 
If that's true, we essentially get the amazing protection of CliffFace while still being on par with UniV2.
On layer 2, these costs won't matter as much but the benefits will be even more pronounced. 
Some minor optimizations were a added but it's important to not get stuck optimizing now. Release to mainnet is top priority.

# Immediate next steps
I'll be ensuring that deployment script successfully deploys only the PyroToken section so that we can deploy to mainnet. UI dev is ensuring all migration use cases in local testnet are successful. 
PyroToken V3 launches after that.
