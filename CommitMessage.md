#MultipleSoulConfigProposal ready
The proposal now handles proxies and morgothTokenApp rover correctly.
There are 2 parameterize functions and they are both additive. That is, if you're listing 10 tokens, you need to call it 10 times. 
Whoever lodges this must ensure that the proposal is locked prior to lodging. After locking, verify that the parameters set are correct. Locking is an MEV protection. Failure to lock could see the wrong tokens put up for voting by a malicious validation agent.

There is a single config proposal. This won't be maintained in code or whitelisted on mainnet. It's just a test helper.
