# Purpose
To ensure that the UIs are built correctly and safely, we require the testnets be versions of the real. Rather than deploy these contracts individually on a network like Goerli, we bring it all together so that we can deploy to local dev-env testnet in one shot

# Known Challenges
- Name collisions in contract names.
- delays in governance
